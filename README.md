User Login: Authenticates users by verifying credentials against stored data and initiates a session upon successful login.
Session Management: Maintains user sessions using cookies or tokens to manage user state across requests.
Protected Dashboard: Restricts access to certain pages or resources, such as a user dashboard, to authenticated users only.
Logout Functionality: Enables users to end their sessions and securely log out of the system.
